

Userstories:

I start my client, it connects to a server(?) and authenticates.
My client requests a userlist, which comes back with user information ( name, ip:port, link speed).
My client then opens connections to all the users.
When the other client receives the connections, my name pops up in the other clients userlist.



I do a search:

My client sends the search request to all connected peers


I download a file:

My client sends a request, with message type download_file, and ID of file.
The peer responds a status  ( OK ), my client begins downloading file. 

OR

My client somehow downloads the file from multiple peers/nodes.
